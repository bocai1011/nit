This is the python script which handles calls to wolf.

It should do a few things:
1) It should check for the existence of an ini file
    -> If one is NOT found, it should build a template, inform the user that it needs to be edited, and stop.
2) It should check that the ini file is valid
3) if should summon wolf and pass it the ini file
