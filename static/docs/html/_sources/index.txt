NEAT
~~~~

**NEAT** is a tool to catch the bad guys.

  - We use `kdb+, q, python, flask, pandas, blaze, javascript, react, react-bootstrap, react-router, highcharts, underscore, c++`
  - We encourage everyone to learn as much of the stack as possible. It makes the team more robust, but also it's just more awesome that way.
  - Great overview of `q <http://code.kx.com/wiki/JB:QforMortals2/contents>`_
  - More `q and kdb+ resources <http://code.kx.com/wiki/Tutorials>`_
  - We use `react.js` on the front end, start `here <https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html>`_ and `see here <https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html>`_
  - We also use `react-bootstrap, react-router, underscore, highcharts, and occasionally jquery and d3`, in that order of frequency/importance.
  - In python land we use `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>`_, and `blaze <http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_.
  - If you can be comfortable with `react`, somewhat comfortable with `flask`, more comfortable with `pandas`, and a little conversant in `q`, that’s a great place to start.
  - Everything else is icing on the cake, but you’ll probably pick it up on the job.
